How to use lookup.sh
	./lookup.sh $1
# $1 = port # of where I'm listening

How to use server.sh
	./server.sh $1 $2 $3 $4
# $1 = hostname of BrokerLookupServer
# $2 = port where BrokerLookupServer is listening
# $3 = port where I will be listening
# $4 = my name ("nasdaq" or "tse")

How to use exchange.sh
	./exchange.sh $1 $2 $3
# $1 = hostname of where BrokerLookupServer is located
# $2 = port # where BrokerLookupServer is listening
# $3 = name of broker you are connecting to ("nasdaq" or "tse")

How to use client.sh:
	./client.sh $1 $2
# $1 = hostname of where BrokerLookupServer is located
# $2 = port # where BrokerLookupServer is listening



Simple example:


On name server side (assuming hostname is ug164)
./lookup.sh 4444 &

On nasdaq broker side
./server.sh ug164 4444 3333 nasdaq &

On tse broker side
./server.sh ug164 4444 2222 tse &

On nasdaq exchange server side - add new nasdaq symbol
./exchange.sh ug164 4444 nasdaq
EXCHANGE> add FOO
EXCHANGE> update FOO 87

On client side - Check for packet forwarding 
./client.sh ug164 4444 
CLIENT> local tse
CLIENT> rim
CLIENT> msft
CLIENT> foo
CLIENT> local nasdaq
CLIENT> rim
CLIENT> msft
CLIENT> foo

Back to nasdaq exchange - remove FOO
REMOVE> FOO

Back on client side - This should return "foo invalid"
CLIENT> foo
