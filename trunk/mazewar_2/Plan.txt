The plan is
	On the client side:
Thread0: GUI
Thread1: MazeImpl/Projectile
Thread2: For every local action, we get a ticket and insert event into the global queue.
Thread3: Will initialize all the connections, starting with naming server. Monitor global queue. Use a "current" event counter and wait for appropiate slot to be filled in. Can use hash-map for the queue, since we will be using SEQ#.
Thread4-N: Will be used for connection with all the other clients. Once event is received it is inserted into queue/hash-map using SEQ#.

How do we initialize game? We have to keep client adds in order.
We can connect to clients once we get the list from the server, but not add them to the map.
Once initiation is done and ticketing service is started each client will send out an add with appropriate SEQ#.

	On the server side:
We start naming service and then ticketing service.
